      <h2>About the "Legion of Roughneck Industrialists" EVE Corp</h2>
      <p>In the MMORPG EVE Online, there are many areas you can focus on, ranging from shooting other real life people, shooting the non-playable enemies spawned by the game, or by making the stuff
       that you blow up. In our corp, we do all of that. We are with a group of likeminded players (nearly 500 of us) spread accross all different timezones, with a heavy presence in the EU / US.
      <br>
    <br>
  This ensures that, if you do decide to play and join our corporation, you would always find someone online to have a laugh with, and access the rich area of in-game content that we have cornered. We're
a friendly bunch who drink, get high, swear etc but when it comes down to it, we'll get you sorted. We'll also help you get started in the game and teach you how to do things, so you won't be left in the dark
to fend for yourselves.<br>
<br>
If you're interested, click the link at the top right and register your account today!<br><br>
<strong>Please note, you do need to have a subscribed account to access the corporation. This is a monthly fee paid to CCP the developer of EVE Online.</strong></p>
